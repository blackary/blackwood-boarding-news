## Emory and Allison B. Get an Early Start on Packing

Today we’ve seen some early packing to move, as Allison and Emory Blackwood have been packing away, very excited for the big move! Emory Blackwood says, “We’ll probably pack 2 or 3 boxes today, then continue throughout the year.” Allie says, “It will like, clean our room, and then we won’t have to like, worry about cleaning our stuff.” The two girls continue to vigorously pack away everything they don’t find necessary for the next year. And when it comes time for the big move, these two will surely be the first ones set and ready to go!

## Into the Basketball season for Elsie Blackwood 

Elsie J. Blackwood, this year’s basketball champ, has just begun her first year on the team. They sadly faced a devastating loss last Saturday at their first game, with a score of 14-24. She says, “I’m hopeful for our next game. I think we might win it, and, the last game was annoying” 

## Progress on the Blackwood House Design

“I’m feeling very optimistic about finishing the architect plans soon” -Flo Blackwood. Yes, we’re all excited that they seem to have come to a conclusion on the basic house design, although we have received this report time and time again only to find that Flo Blackwood has changed her mind again and wants to re-do the whole thing. Many people are sceptical about whether this is really the final thing. Expect hearing something like this in the next few days: “Hmm… I don’t love it… Maybe if we just don’t do this part… No, no, that won’t work.. Yep, I think I’ll have to start over, I don’t know what I was thinking. This house design is not what I was envisioning.” The question remains, is this the last we’ll hear of the house's major design? Probably not.
