## A Not-So-Tragic Murder

This week, BBSG faced a tragedy–just kidding! The wonderfully marvelous death of “Long Joe” has finally come! He lived a long life, full of driving and bumping around, and taller people running into him, but now to the relief of many, he is gone! A new phase of life has begun! We have finally and at last really truly come back to Indiana!!!!! It has been a long loooong long long long long long long (well you get the point) journey and students are exceedingly glad to have come home after many months of traveling!

## Advancement on ???

Since we’ve been gone most of the work done on our house has been mostly electrical, plumbing, etc. However all the doors and a few showers have now been installed. With work progressing and the completion nearing, Flo Blackwood is wondering what we are going to call our residence once we move in. Green Gables 2.0? Angel Acres? Blackwood Estate? Send us your ideas at you-know-where! We can use all the recommendations we can get.

## New “Bling Bling” for Elsie

This week Blackwood Boarding student Elsie Blackwood went on an exciting trip to the mall, not just to your average day of clothes shopping and bubble gum machines though. She stopped at Claire’s for her twelfth birthday coming up in a few days, and got her ears pierced. She was very nervous and descriptively explained, “My stomach was like doing flips… I felt like it was gonna hurt a lot a lot but then it didn’t hurt that much. It felt like in between really really painful and not that painful” There you have it! Uh, if that made sense.
