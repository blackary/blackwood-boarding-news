## And…Action!

Early this week, BBSG found out that an extremely famous tool company called Festool has decided they want to film a commercial at our new house!!! The video will present one of our builders using Fes-tools on the house, and will be shown on television all over the United States and Europe! Sometime this week the lights and cameras will come to Angelic Lane, and Blackwood Manor will be turned into a full blown Hollywood production! Elsie Blackwood says, “I am planning to smuggle myself on-set, so hopefully they don’t edit me out of the shoot. Also, I will be happy to sign autographs.”

## Cactus Flop

While in Joshua Tree national park, Flo Blackwood rushed everyone out the door one early morning to witness “a glistening cactus in the sunrise” when the dew would supposedly melt off the needles like jewels. Unfortunately, it took everyone a while to wake up, get dressed, eat something, get on their shoes, and get into the car, so we were about forty-five minutes late for sunrise. Everybody walked through the short path with small cactuses all around, and got back in the car to drive back.

## The Chaos Continues

Blackwood Boarding has been on the road for days now, from more national parks, to gas stations, to truckstops. Everyone is ready for a break. Thankfully, Long Joe 2 is getting shorter by the day, and not only is he counting down to when we can return to Lafayette, but also to Christmas break! With only four days left on the paper chain, we all hope we will survive till then.
