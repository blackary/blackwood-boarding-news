## The Worst Day Ever

This week, while Zachary Blackwood was away on a business trip, BBSG had an  impressively bad day. Flo Blackwood was so wrapped up in packing and helping people with their school work, that she completely forgot about Allison’s doctor's appointment, meanwhile in the kitchen there was a tremendous failure on a batch of cream puffs which one of the students commented was, “yucky”. Things were going fairly badly at this point, so Flo B. decided to go get some pizza to perk things up a bit. Unfortunately, while she was gone, the BBSG main toilet overflowed and flooded the hallway. When she returned, the floors were beginning to get soaked because no one knew where she had put the towels. After it was mostly mopped up and the fan was running in the hallway, everyone sat down to watch a movie and eat the pizza Flo had brought. Alas, the pizza contained spicy sauce and some sort of leaves which most of the students were revolted by. So for the rest of the night everyone was crying of hunger and salvaging what leftovers they could find in the fridge. Finally, it was time for everyone to head to bed. But, when all the girls were in their room, they discovered the ‘Adventures in Odyssey’ website wasn’t working. This of course, caused more tears, yelling, and pulling of hair. When everything had calmed down a little, Allison B. prayed that, “This day would be over.” 

## Off with Her Hair!

To surprise her father and principal when he returned from a trip to San Francisco, Grace B. decided it was time for her annual ‘hair chop’. After thinning it a bit, Flo Blackwood cut off about ten inches. And she is loving her new look! 

## El Muro Misses out on the Game

Elsie Blackwood was sad to bypass her basketball this Saturday when she caught a rather bad cold. Sadly, without the great “El Muro” the team had another horrible loss. She is hoping to make their last game next week however, to finish strong! Gooooooooo Boilermakers!!!
