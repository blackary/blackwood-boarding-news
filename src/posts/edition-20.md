## Transition Fiasco

Shortly after our returning from our trip with the Lutz girls, we had to vacate our school building and move into a campground near town. Everyone cramped into the repulsively vitriolic metal box in the driveway and the next day drove twenty minutes to a tiny lot on a tiny lane in a tiny camping space. We also sadly were forced to give up our prized class pet, Orange Washington, the four-year-old 25 cent goldfish. He was adopted by the Baby-Held family who we’re sure will take great care of him. Most students at this point are hoping that the trip doesn’t last the whole nine months, and that maybe the teachers and board members will agree to end it at three mo. We are also looking forward to camp later this week, when we will stay in rooms with plenty of space and other people to talk to. 

## Congrats Grads!

The past week was full of excitement with four grad parties, and the homeschool graduation ceremony. All of the students are off to Purdue of course where they will continue yet more school. The parties were fabulous (especially the ones with ziplines!) They provided the entire school with free dinner, breakfast, lunch, and dinner again which was great since we are trying to work with a very small dining room and kitchen at the moment in our school cafeteria. 

## Little Progress on the House
Though construction on the new BBSG is happening, it sure is going slow. For reasons no one knows, the entire school must take a field trip to the site every day, but there isn’t much to see and students are unimpressed. Hopefully it gets done soon, because we may not survive much longer in our disturbingly small living quarters.
