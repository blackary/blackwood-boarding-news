## A Chocolatey Excursion

This week (after going to Colonial William’s burg, which was interesting but we had too many things on the list of newsworthy topics to squeeze it in) we took a little detour to…Hershey’s Chocolate World!!! It was very vibrant, including the world’s biggest sold Hershey bars, KitKats, and Jolly Ranchers candies, as well as a free factory tour in a rolling cart, and free chocolate bars! “I liked how we got to go on a ride and see them make chocolate and stuff.” one BBSG student commented. Moreover, it was a thrilling experience that we would significantly recommend. 

## Another RV Birthday?

The 29th was Felicity Blackwood’s birthday, although it was not as fancy shmancy as Elsie’s it was still a pleasant day with doughnuts for breakfast, ice cream after dinner, and many “happy birthday” calls (including one from the entire RGC youth group back home!) During the day we did school, and went antiquing with Mom to get some little tables in need of restoration and things. Though it was tragic that we had to have yet another birthday “celebration” in the RV, it was about as good as parties on the road get.

## Walls!

BBSG has arrived back home once again, and just in time to witness lots of advancement in the house! From now on there will be no more walking through barriers because there are now walls! The builders have been working very hard to get all the drywall up, and the inside is now beginning to look like a real house. Flo Blackwood says,“Very pleased, I am very pleased with the project! It is just how I envisioned it. Just absolutely love it!” The Blackwood Boarding Girls agree, and there were many screams and squeals of delight when we first entered the newly walled home.
