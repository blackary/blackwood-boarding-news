## Back Home and at The Cove!

Everyone was very excited when we got back to Lafayette last Tuesday, and ready to take a break from traveling the world. Flo Blackwood has given many tours of the house to visitors, and students have enjoyed seeing all our long lost friends again! One of the things we did while we were here was, of course, spend a day at the town swimming hole. Felicity and Elsie Blackwood did every single slide (other than the fishy) including the dreaded green loop de loop!!! By the way, to anyone reading this, feel free to come for a visit for a personal tour of the house, and maybe a canoe ride on Lake Felicity, because we’ll be here until Thursday, before we have to go on another ten year trip in our cramped camper.

## More Wedding Bells

The Faris family welcomed our 43rd grandkid/nephew/cousin and second in-law grandkid/nephew/cousin this Saturday, A-A-Ron Smith who married Nadia! It was a big day for everyone, especially the matchmaker Caleb Faris. He even got a pink glittery sash, which he wore with honor. There was dancing, cake, and speeches. Congratulations to the new Smith family from BBSG!

## Re-Building the Trampoline

After many days of trying to build our old trampoline at our new land, we finally finished it! We had to drop by Menard’s to get a few parts we’de lost, but one part for pulling the springs back, was not available at any stores nearby. A few attempts at going without it, and Zachary B. proclaimed, “Turns out, I guess we do need that little tool.” After we borrowed the tool from the Allgier family, we were at last able to finish the bouncy-uh-thing!
