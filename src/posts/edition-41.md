## New Dog at The Farm

This week BBSG students were very excited to get to meet Grandma and Grandpa Faris’s new dog, Mayetta (The old one tragically passed away at only five years old a few days earlier.) who is a rat terrier-border collie mix from a puppy rescue farm nearby. The pup is only three and a half months old, and even though she’s nearly twenty-five pounds, Lottie and Allison Blackwood were carrying (and possibly strangling) her all over the place. Welcome to the family May!

## Low Tourism

Since we’ve been back, unlike last time Flo Blackwood has given very few tours of the house, even though now it is much more impressive since there are walls. The workers have been finishing up the drywall mudding and even started on the painting yesterday. Hopefully this fad of low tourists won’t be damaging to the economy, as it would be in many places around the world.

## Let it Snow!

The first snow of the year has hit West Lafayette, and winter is officially here! White, fluffy flakes fell from the sky like feathers after a slumber party pillow fight all Sunday afternoon and through the night, and continued Monday morning. Speaking of a winter wonderland, the Blackwood Boarding girls also witnessed the northern lights on Angelic Lane this week. As the colorful lights painted the sky Flo B. exclaimed, “Wow! I have just always wanted to see the northern lights in person! This is a big deal!”
