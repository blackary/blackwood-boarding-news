## Hanging with Edison and Ford

This week BBSG went to the Edison and Ford estate in Southwest Florida and learned many things about Thomas You-Know-Who and his friend Henry, who made cars. Elsie Blackwood says, “Well there were more flowers than I expected…and it was kinda funny how Mom was always like ‘Oh yes, it should be right over here’ and then it wasn’t.” While walking around the grounds, Blackwood Boarding Girls learned that Henry Ford paid his employees twice as much as other car manufacturers. One student mentioned that he probably did this so that they could a-Ford more cars!

## Saddling Up!

While we were staying at a horse border farm (still in Florida, of course) the owners courteously allowed us to ride their horses for free! Everyone enjoyed learning the basics of horseback riding, and feeding lots of cookies to the horses. In the words of Cowgirl Lottie, “It was SO fun!!!” 

## BBSG at ECHO

While in the area, Zachary and Flo Blackwood decided to take the school to ECHO the Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization. They volunteered there as teenagers, and when their wonderful first daughter was very young. It’s a huge farm where they test new planting methods and give their ideas to small farmers around the world so they can support their families. It was very interesting to see all their varieties of plants, and taste some! “It was so wonderful and mastalgic to be back at ECHO again. In some ways it has changed a lot and in some ways it’s the same.” -Zachary Blackwood
