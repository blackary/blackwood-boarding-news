## Back Home Yet Again in Indiana…

This week BBSG made the long drive home after weeks away, and everyone was very ready to settle down, and fully enjoy our tourism break. As soon as we drove up 544 Angelic Lane, all the Blackwood Boarding Girls clambered out the Repulsively Vitriolic’s doors and dashed into the Blackwood Manor house. Everyone ran to the basement first, to see where we would be sleeping and to test out the new carpet. Little did we know that there was a lovely set up of Christmas decorations from our builders! A tree (with bags of popcorn!) and fairy lights on the ceiling. Allie Blackwood in particular started screaming, and running around. The basement also included cabinets, a finished bathroom, and a hideout under the stairs with a little door and sparkly rainbow chandelier inside. 

## Chaotic Jibes to Cozy Vibes

After we had all come into the basement of Blackwood Manor, the “settling down” didn’t last long. People started bringing in their blankets, pillows, stuffed animals, etc. Then it was time for the new couches. One of the builders, Cassandra, helped us move boxes of couch ingredients from the garage down to the basement, unpackage them, and attempt to assemble the couch. For a day boxes were strewn everywhere, chunks of couch stood unfinished in the livingroom, and sleeping things laid on the floor. Then Flo and Zachary Blackwood finally finished the project at 10:00 p.m. on the second night, and things began to get more organized. Allie B. says, “It’s very cozy.” while Emory Blackwood comments, “I like it, OK?! Stop interviewing me.” 

## Cole Christmas 2025

The annual Cole family gathering happened this week. And Lottie Blackwood was especially excited for the event, since she couldn’t remember any previous ones. BBSG girls enjoyed Aunt Laura’s hot chocolate, party games, prizes, and the white elephant. One of the odd gifts brought home was a four foot tall blow-up Santa Clause which you can see for yourself if you come tour our house!
