## Devastation and Math

Warning, due to high levels of trepidation enclosed in this article, we recommend that children still having a great summer, read with an adult, or hold on tight to a teddy bear while perusing this section of the paper. This week, a horrible tragedy has taken place. To our dismay, the ‘S’ in BBSG stands for school. Thanks to the RV, students of Blackwood Boarding were forced against their will to (terrifying music please) start school–early. Mugshots were taken of each student on the first day stating their name and grade. After receiving a scanty two month summer, and having to travel for most of it, Blackwood Boarding girls are obviously all thinking the same thing, “We need a refund on our summer.”

## Be’an Outsiders

After walking around L.L. Bean’s main headquarters, Flo Blackwood said, “It was disappointing that it was under construction, but I LOVED the home decor section!” Although most items in the huge store were hundreds of dollars overpriced, BBSG students could get a free pair of cheapo sunglasses for wearing an L.L. Bean temporary tattoo. Students also enjoyed wearing the large backpack set up for tourists, and looking at the monstrously sized boots on display outside. 

## Experiences in Maine
Maine is known to the rest of America as “Vacationland” however, it’s really not all that wonderful. Ever heard of tidepooling? They’ll tell you it’s so great, well, if your idea of great is gross slimy smelly seaweed everywhere, rocks, and the strong smell of dead fish, then it’s just fantastic! The people in the state of Maine also have some very interesting ideas on how to do simple things, like, eat food. Practically all their food is seafood. They manage to take ordinary edibles like pizza, and caesar salad, and make them taste like fish. Another weird thing they do is cut hotdog buns  from the top down, rather than on the side! Outrageous! They also have this thing for blueberry ice cream…yuck.
