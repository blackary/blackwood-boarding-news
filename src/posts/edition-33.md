## Highlights of Yellowstone

Since our car broke down about a week ago, we have been stuck in Yellowstone NP for a little (or a lot) longer than we had planned. We have seen plenty of geysers, hot pools, bison, and elk. And of course we waited for forever for “Ye Olde Faithful” to erupt, for a photo and a, well, not very impressive experience, since we saw plenty of bigger geysers around the park. Probably the best thing though, was the huckleberry ice cream we got from the general store which Lottie especially, highly recommends.
## The Countdown Begins 
This week, students at BBSG could hardly believe it has only been about two weeks since we started this leg of our trip! We’ve still got about five to go. To pass the time, Blackwood Boarding Girls have begun planning all the things to do when we get back, and made a very veryyy long paper chain countdown of forty links! “Long Joe” as the countdown chain has come to be called is now one link down, thirty-nine to go.
## Cast Chop-off 
Allison Blackwood was very excited to take off her stylish, yet not very comfortable, cast recently. Her broken arm, according to her, she got about twelve years ago when she was crossing the street, and dropped her prized seven-carrot diamond! Then she got down and reached out to retrieve it, but then suddenly a car rolled over her arm, breaking it in two places! Though this story may have been slightly dramatized, hopefully most of you browsing though this paper, can read through the lines.
