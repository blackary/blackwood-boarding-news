## Missing A Winter Wonderland

Being in warm and sunny Florida in January can be pleasant, but 85 degree weather in the middle of winter can be a bit unsettling. Believe it or not, many BBSG students miss the cold winter, however Allison is taking advantage of being able to wear sunglasses to protect her “delicate blue eyes”, and look stylish. 

## Splashing with Granda and Nana

This week we were able to see Zachary Blackwood’s parents (Granda and Nana) at their very fancy timeshare. They happened to be down south for a conference at the same time we were, so Blackwood Boarding Girls were very pleased to get to see them again. There were two large heated pools at their timeshare, with two hot tubs, and water fountains! We also enjoyed sharing three half pints of delicious ice cream. It was a lovely visit and swim that felt very luxurious! 

## Time with Grandma Cole

Zachary Blackwood’s grandmother who winters in Florida has had a lovely (hopefully not too chaotic) visit from her five great granddaughters who were very excited to see her, and her tiny dog, Winkie. That last bit was mostly Lottie though. We’ve done a lot with her this week; a children’s museum, Golden Corral, golf-carting around her neighborhood, Culver’s, seeing our great-great-aunts, and Karaoke night! It has been a great visit that will not be quickly forgotten.
