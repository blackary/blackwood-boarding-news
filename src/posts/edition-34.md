## Car Troubles Continued

When our car broke down in Yellowstone about two weeks ago, Zachary Blackwood desperately tried to find a mechanic that could do the job in less than a week. He found someone who said they would look at it first thing the next day. Well, he called them the next day and they said that they would look at it the next day. The next day, they said they would do it the next week. On Monday Zachary called them again, and they explained that they might be able to work on our vehicle the next day. Finally when the next afternoon came, the mechanics were able to take a look at our car. Then they called and told us that they were sorry, but they couldn’t fix our car. So it went to another mechanic who realized that the only problem was we were missing a little ten cent fuse that could easily be replaced. So now BBSG’s car is fixed at last.

## Our Private Beach 

This week, Blackwood Boarding stayed the night at a campsite that had its own little path to the perfect beach on the lake! Of course, students loved swimming in the pool-temperatured water. And we even found a log that made a great little boat. There was also fishing, swimming races, and eating of cheeto puffs. 

## Birthday Coming Up! 

Allison Blackwood is very excited for her eighth birthday (also our Grandpa’s birthday on the same day) coming up very soon. She will also be allowed to graduate out of her booster seat and into a regular grown-up seat! Although this is exciting, she commented, “I’m mostly excited about getting my presents.” Good thing, because the rest of BBSG went shopping for gifts a few days ago. Some people may have been a little more focused on things they would like more than Allie though…
