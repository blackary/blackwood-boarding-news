## BBSG - Now In Theatres

After a long and frankly boring day of driving through Oklahoma and Kansas, Zachary Blackwood decided to surprise the Blackwood Boarding Girls with a trip to the theatre to see the second part of Wicked! Everyone enjoyed the buttery popcorn and exciting movie. It was very shocking and, no spoilers, but if you watch it, it will change your perspective on The Wizard of Oz forever!

## An Exotic Thanksgiving

This week, as everyone probably knows, was Thanksgiving, and Blackwood Boarding went to Kansas City to commemorate the holiday with some of Dad’s relatives (who we had never met.) Before digging into the pumpkin pie, turkey, and homemade ice cream prepared by Aunt Cheryle, our second cousin Maddie let everyone see and hold her pet rats and python, which was rather…anomalous. To top that, there were even turtles and catfish in an inflatable pool on their screened in and heated porch! The house was practically a zoo of reptiles, fish, and rats. Other than the odd pets, it was a nice, traditional holiday.

## Icy Conditions

While trying to escape the Midwest winter blizzard season kicking in, the Repulsively Vitriolic raced through the snow and ice, Flo Blackwood tightly gripping the wheel. It was a long cold journey, and now in Colorado the weather is less snowy. However, our windows will still freeze with thick icy layers inside and out overnight. After hours of driving, the school car which was towed behind the RV was utterly coated in dirty slush, and the wheels of the RV and car had icicles forming a circle. Hopefully things warm up, because some people are running out of blankets!
