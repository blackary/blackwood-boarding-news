## Rushin’ to More Tourist Attractions

This week we paid a visit to our pals George, Tom, Teddy, and Abe. We were driving through the area so we stopped to take a quick pic to say we'd been there. We also learned that the whole reason it was even built was to bring tourists, like us, to South Dakota since their economy was failing. In other words, Mt. Rushmore is kind of a ripoff. But we stayed long enough to take our family photo, and you’ll notice that most of us are kind of…half smiling. 

## The Bad Bad Bad Lands

The scorching sun beat down upon every living thing. The grass crunched beneath our feat, and the dry ground cracked and crumbled. This is what we experienced when we visited the Bad Lands National Park. All day every day we closed all the blinds on the windows, not daring to take a step outside, except in the cooler evenings, and sweating inside our black, metal, box of a house. When we went on hikes at night, Flo Blackwood was very concerned about rattle snakes, so she asked everyone what to do if they saw one. Lottie B. answered, “Step away slowly…and then zoom in and take a picture!” We all wondered who she gets ideas like this from…hmm. While we were there, our water also stopped working! So we were hot, thirsty, and dry until we had to take the RV to the shop a few hours away. By the time the water pump issue was fixed, it was about time to keep moving, thankfully, to colder weather.

## Camping with Cousins
After we left the Bad Lands, we moved onto Wyoming where some of our Blackwood cousins live. Here we went camping in our camper for pretty much the first time! The temperatures were very low, and everything was cold and sweater-wethery. We enjoyed hiking, climbing rocks, and cooking hotdogs over the fire with our little cousins Henry, Marian, and Gemma.
