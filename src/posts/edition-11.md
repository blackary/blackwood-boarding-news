## Upcoming Student Body Presidential Election

The BBSG presidential election happens this Wednesday, where several candidates will give speeches, and the students will vote on a president, and vice president. Allison and Emory Blackwood are running against each other for the office of president, while Elsie and Lottie Blackwood are running for Vice President. Stakes are high, and it looks like it will be a close race!

## Narrow Bathroom Escape

A guest visiting Blackwood Boarding from Ohio this week was just about to leave, when the woman went to the bathroom, only to find that she had locked herself in. After a lot of pushing and pulling from the inside and out, Elsie B. went in to rescue her by scrambling through the underground crawl space after climbing into the trap door in the kitchen which leads to another door in the bathroom. Elsie brought along with her a screwdriver, and a few other tools, and after about 20 minutes, the two of them along with Zachary Blackwood from the outside were able to dismantle the doorknob, and rescue the lady. It was a close call, but the guest made it out, safe and sound.

## RGC Youth Group Girls’ Night
On Saturday, all of the youth group girls from Redeeming Grace Church spent the night at the Lutz family AirBnB in town, enjoying luxurious spa treatments, and jell nails, as well as board games, sliding down the stairs in sleeping bags, and lots more. There was an hour break for prayer and singing, but the party didn’t end there. We ate plenty of candy and junk food, and even started a movie that everyone was too exhausted to finish. By 3:00 AM everyone had gone to bed, after partying for 12 hours straight! Much thanks to the Lutz family for providing the space, Kyla A. for polishing nails until eleven, the girls’ discussion leaders at youth group who helped out too, and of course all the girls who came to make it a fun time!
