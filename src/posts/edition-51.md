## Off Again

This week it was time yet again to drive far far away, away from Blackwood Manor, Lafayette, Indiana, and the entire Midwest! Thankfully though, this will be our final round-about through the continental U.S., and as soon as Long Joe Number 3 is finished, we will be rid of the RV for good! Long Joe 3 is a little different though then the first two, since the long paper chains kept getting in the way, we have switched to a row of star stickers swirling around the ceiling, air conditioning vents, and ending on the coat cabinet. It started with 45 stickers, and is now down to 39. 

## Sunshine in Florida

The main state BBSG will be travelling in this loop is Florida, and it is sure different then what winter is like back home! While it wasn’t quite warm enough to swim, some people had fun soaking themselves up to their wastes in the cold water in their clothes! Others preferred finding little sea shells and trying to keep dry. Thankfully, it looks like things will be warming up soon so BBSG will have the full “Summer in January” effect. But some are also missing the cold and snow of course.

## Happy Birthday Martin Parade

For Martin Luther King Jr. Day, BBSG visited a local parade organized for the holiday. Shortly after it started, we began being rained upon with candy and bead necklaces, but as the parade marched on, more prizes and merchandise were thrown to the spectators. However, these weren’t all your usual parade freebies. There were thousands of bead necklaces, stuffed animals, moon pies, balls, mini cereal boxes, instant chicken soup, and even one man walked around passing out wads of dollar bills! After a few hours, our backpacks, cups, pockets, and arms were all full to bursting and we had to leave for fear of being buried in merchandise! Everyone at Blackwood Boarding would give the celebration a huge thumbs up, and recommend it to anyone, but Elsie B. commented, “My neck was so heavy by the end from all the necklaces!”
