## Fun Weekend of Work at The Faris Farm

From Thursday to Saturday, a few of us granddaughters of Jerri and David Faris spent time fixing up their living space. Elsie Blackwood came up Friday afternoon to join the team, and boy did we get a lot done! We spent the days scrubbing the cabinets, washing and polishing the windows, vacuuming, trimming bushes, edging the walkway with shovels, sweeping, moping, and lots more. After a day of work, we spent the nights partying with Grandma, having root-beer floats, cinnamon rolls, cookies, ice cream and candy, playing board games, getting very slap happy, and watching late-night movies. It really was an exciting  and successful weekend! 

## March Madness Begins

Well March Madness is here again. One of the students at BBSG has had a record low score this year, managing to come in last place in the RGC and Faris Family groups, but is now doing better in third to last, right alongside all the four-year-olds whose winning teams are already out! At least good ol’ Purdue is still hanging in there (and doing a lot better than the 9-11 Boilermakers fortunately). And if any of you think you can get a perfect bracket, it’s estimated that your chances are in the quintillions. Happy March!

## Time to Get Your  Vitamin D!

It’s come again to one of Grandpa Faris’ favorite seasons! Now is the best time of the year to lay out in the sun and absorb all that healthy vitamin D. He has sent out the following link: <https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/@4918667> for you to look up optimal vitamin D absorption time in your area. “If you have any questions I am available,” Grandpa has said, “my fees are pretty reasonable.”
