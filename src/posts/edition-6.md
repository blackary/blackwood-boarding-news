## A Successful RGC Youth Group Pancake Breakfast

We had an amazing pancake-filled morning on Saturday which tripled as a fun social event, a free meal, and a fundraiser for the Youth Group’s retreat in April. Some of the creative young cooks even offered personalized pancakes, including initials, animals, or even the occasional circle! We also had very generous donations this year, and even received two hundred dollar bills. The total added up to almost one thousand dollars!! It looks like the Redeeming Grace youth group will be having an incredible get-away this spring.

## The Boilermakers Press on with Great Sportsmanship

Well, the Boilers lost again. They had a very loudly cheering audience this game (mainly Jerri Faris) yet they still faced another devastating loss. It’s been a very discouraging season for all the fans and players. We’re still holding on to one teeny tiny hope that they might win at least one game, just one…maybe. Keep cheering. That’s all we can say. Keep cheering.



## More Boxes Needed at BBSG

The past week at Blackwood Boarding has been full of packing, packing, and more packing. Flo Blackwood especially has been extremely vigorous in boxing up anything that we might survive without for a year. Many students have found that lots of their daily-used items have gone missing, and the rooms are beginning to look empty. We’re even starting to get desperate for boxes, packaging paper, and satisfyingly poppable bubble wrap. And why? You may ask. Because the horrid 9-month Repulsively Vitriolic, or RV, trip is really happening. We have purchased our fourth “house”...Unfortunately.
