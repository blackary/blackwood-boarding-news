## Flo Blackwood the Tourguide

While we were back living on our land on angelic lane, Flo B. gave many tours of the house, aka the new BBSG school building  to many people. In fact, there were at least six tours given, to as many as 27 people! Some guides through the house took as long as forty-five minutes in each room! If you didn’t get a chance to see it while we were in town, we will be back again in just a short…four to five weeks.

## Little House On the Prairie

One of our first stops on this leg of our trip was the land Laura Ingalls and her family lived on from when she was 12 to 18. There were wagons, and kittens, and an old school house from the area, and horseback riding. There was a five-day-old foal when we got there, but that night as Allison said, he was almost six. There was also a big storm the night we stayed there, and there was even a tornado! After we left students were debating whether or not this place would out-rank the acclaimed alpaca farm. We’re still not quite sure, but it’s a close race.

## Wild Animals of the Wild West

In Teddy Roosevelt National Park, we encountered herds of wild horses, prairie dogs, and herds of bison. In fact, we were driving to a hiking spot when there was a large group of bison crossing the road, but then they turned toward us and came so close, we could have reached out and touched them! This caused a small traffic jam, but fortunately no horns ramming into cars.
