## Goodbye to the Christmas Tree
This week, Flo Blackwood has finally taken down the Blackwood Christmas Tree. It was taken away from us on January 31st 2025. It was a very beautiful tree, and his memory will live on in our hearts. Many students have had a hard time coping with the loss, it has been a truly tragic time at Blackwood Boarding School for Girls. Now, we wish our farewell to our dear beloved tree; goodbye Christmas Tree--goodbye.


## Mud Fest at Redeeming Grace
This Sunday after evening service at Redeeming Grace church, it was so warm that all the kids went outside for a good game of ghosts in the graveyard. But, due to all the melting snow and rain lately, the church’s yard had been turned into a giant muddy swamp. And so, it didn’t take long before all the front steps, sidewalks, shoes, pants, railings, and doors were caked in the icky sludge. There is a severe mud warning in effect until later this week. Watch out, and stay clean!

## Boilermakers Defeated by the Fever
The old Boilers lost again, but they are getting better every game! There is still hope! There even seem to be many people even on the other teams cheering for us, wearing all the Purdue gear. Our players are getting more confident every day. We might even win next time. Who knows? Find out for yourself at McAllister Recreation Center at 8:30 am this Saturday. Boiler up, hammer down! Woohoo!!
