## Not One Not Two…

But three cousin slumber parties in one week! While the Magill family was visiting from Nairobi in Africa, we had time to spend time with a few of the girls. We enjoyed splashing in the pond, and eating lots of ice cream with them. Night number one was spent with Eliya, then Grace, and finally Eve. All three girls made sure we watched a movie, and had ice cream each night they were here. As Grace put it, “They are requirements of any girls’ sleepover.” 

## A Day to Rove at the Cove
For the first time this summer, a group of kids, including BBSG, spent the day at Tropicanoe Cove, the town water park. Running around the lazy river, going down the tube slide a few times, speed walking over to the race slide, and making a stop at our spot under the umbrella for some snacks. We did this over and over for hours, and came home with plenty of sunburn, freckles, and memories.

## A Beary Long Hike

On Monday, we managed to hike a total of five and a half miles through the woods in the Appalachian mountains. After many many speeches from Mom on What to do if you Encounter a Bear throughout our entire lives, we were finally able to put our skills to the test! As a few of us were hiking a little ahead of the others, we thought we saw a person coming up, walking a dog. But wait, where was the owner? And the dog wasn’t even on a leash. It was a very big puppy, and very chubby and black. Then we got a clear look at it, it wasn’t a dog at all! There in front of us, was the first bear in the wild we had ever seen! Well, the proper procedure would then be to back away slowly and talk kindly to the bear facing it, but we did the exact opposite and ran away shouting, “We saw a bear!” Well, the rest of the hike was getting back to our car as fast as possible at Mom’s urging, and making as much noise as possible.
