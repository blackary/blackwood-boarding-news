## Another Sad loss for the Boilermakers

The Boilers basketball team faced another disappointing loss last Saturday at their second game of the season. When asked if she thought they would win the next match, Star player Audrey Lutz replied, “Nope!” But the fans are still hopeful. And even if we do lose again, will still jauntily cheer them on, and have a fun time!

## Warmer weather at last!

After weeks of below-freezing temperatures and highs of 2 degrees, the sun is finally peeking out. Zachary Blackwood is even able to take Teddy on walks again since our road is no longer entirely a sheet of ice. Today we’ve had scorching heat with 46 degree weather! It’s practically summer already!

## Valentine’s Day party Coming up!!

We are all very excited for this year’s Valentine’s Day party held right here at Blackwood Boarding School for Girls! Although we will have a bit of a twist this year as we’re inviting the first ever boy, Ezer, who was invited by Lottie Blackwood. He will also be the youngest ever invitee at 3 years old. Also look forward to many fun games and snacks at this fun party. We will have the usual Valentine card exchange, candy heart hunt, movie, and hearty hors d’oeuvres, along with a few other games and activities. So get excited for one sensational Valentine’s day!!
