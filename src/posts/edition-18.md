## A Touch of Much Dutch

The “Maiden Voyage” has begun at Blackwood Boarding, and the two guinea pigs, Jane and Audrey Lutz, are having a terrific time too! One of our first stops was a fun place called “Dutch Village” in Holland MI. It provided a peek into Dutch culture long ago, and also included carnival rides, adorable animals, traditional foods and dances, all free upon entry! Unfortunately, near the end of our visit, a genuine, one- of-a-kind water bottle from Downtown Dental was realized to be missing! The students and teachers split up and searched the park for the precious merchandise, and were eventually able to find it near one of the rides. Other than that, we had a great time and would highly recommend Dutch Village to anyone visiting the area.

## Experiencing the Plague of Flies

Ever since we reached Mackinac City beach, there have been literally billions of tiny flies all over the place! Thick black swarms cover the beaches, the campgrounds, everywhere! Some campers were even spotted wearing beekeeper masks as they walked around. White cars have turned black, and young children from BBSG have ended up in tears after going on a short walk because of the dense mobs of bugs making it almost impossible to function. Fortunately, further into town and far from the lake, the number of insects decreases dramatically. We’re looking forward to moving onto Wisconsin, where we will hopefully escape this “plague” which really does remind us of the story of the fourth Egyptian plague in Exodus chapter eight. 

## The Place of The Great Turtle

This week, most of us had the wonderful opportunity of sailing over on a Ferry to Mackinac Island for a day, and exploring the unique lifestyle, without cars which are prohibited on the island. Instead, locals and tourists travel on horses pulling carriages or bikes. The small area of land is called Mackinac (pronounced Mackinaw) which is the Indian word meaning, “Great Turtle” because the shape of the island resembles that of an ocean tortoise. We enjoyed walking around, seeing the incredible views, and tasting some of their famous fudge. M-m-goooooood!
