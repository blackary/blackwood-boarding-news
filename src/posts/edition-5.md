## A Smashing Valentine’s Day Party!

**We had a great hearty party this Saturday with balloons, limbo, dancing, and passing out valentines! All the girls (and boy) had a lot of fun celebrating and chit-chatting. This year, we had a new record of 25 guests, who really made it one festive get together! We served a very lavish five-course meal consisting of the finest chicken nuggets from Tyson, some delectable broccoli and carrots, rolls, fruit, and bubbly champagne (grape juice). And of course, there was a lovely desert of cupcakes and cookies, along with all the candy everyone received after the card exchange. By the way, if anyone reading this is in need of some Valentine’s-themed balloons, give the staff at BBSG a call!**

## Emory Blackwood Decides to Change Her Name

**Emory B., a student at Blackwood Boarding, has decided to now be called by her middle name, Grace. This happens to also be her mother’s first name. But some are sceptical that this new title will really stick after more than 8 years of calling her Emory. However, Emory-sorry-Grace is confident that her friends and family will understand her desire to give this a shot, and will try their hardest to succeed in switching things up.** 

## Flo B. Comes up with a Ridonculous Idea

**Recently G. Flo B. has been planning something that most would say is a horrendously awful proposal. She is thinking that while BBSG’s new location is being constructed, the whole school-yes--the whole school should go and “travel the U.S.” for nine months in a teeny tiny RV. And they’ve been looking into the dirty old glorified pick-ups for the past week. This is likely a waste of time, as the whole thing will go down the tubes as soon as we take a trip longer than 3 hours in the isolating vehicle. Will this be disastrous for Blackwood Boarding? Yes. There is a %99.9 percent chance everyone will despise this abominable vacation.**
