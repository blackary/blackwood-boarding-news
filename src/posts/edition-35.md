## Life in San Francisco

This week we have come to yet another big city. San Francisco is full of lots of teslas and AI companies. This has been our longest stay in any one place on this loop so we have been here all week. And yes, we have driven over (and under) the Golden Gate bridge a few times. Although it isn’t actually gold, when we went there at night the lights made the usually red bridge have a goldy colour, the other reason the red bridge is called gold is the golden gate was there before the bridge.

## Aquarium Day Trip 

While in San Fran we went to an aquarium with our friend from Indiana. There was a show with tuna and sardines swirling around in a giant tank, which Flo Blackwood says, “Oh my word, it was mesmerizing! It was by far my favorite part of the aquarium. Absolutely wonderful! All their shimmery scales, just, bouncing off the light…just amazing.” And there were also many other types of fish, along with otters, jelly fish, tiger sharks, and penguins. 

## Bring your Kids to Snowflake Day 

Right now, Zachary Blackwood is having some sort of Streamlit conference thing at his company, Snowflake. The building is very fancy, BBSG students love going there as much as possible. There are fancy name tags everyone receives with their pictures on them upon entry, and lots of snow-related things. There is also a cafeteria with multiple main course dining choices (mexican, burgers, pizza, etc.) as well as a salad bar, toppings, and a full soda fountain! You can even go there for breakfast! And everything is free! Zachary of course has a desk upstairs, with a trophy he won a while ago. Downstairs, they have an arcade as well! Blackwood Boarding Girls have also met pretty much all of Zachary’s co-workers, many of whom read this paper. So if you want a really exciting place to go to take-your-kid-to-work day, get your dad a job at Snowfake.
