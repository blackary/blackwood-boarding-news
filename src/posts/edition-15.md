## We Ran for Justice!
There was a great turnout at the 5/10k run organised by IJM, and they had record high participants this year, with over 500 runners! Team Redeeming Grace had people representing us in the five and ten km, both running and walking. The first student of BBSG to cross the finish line was Felicity B. in 228th place (running), next was Elsie B. in 247th place (also running). And the walkers from Blackwood Boarding were: Emory B. in 362nd place, Zachary B. in 339th, and finally Flo B. in 361st place. Allison and Lottie Blackwood ran in the kids' dash the night before, so even though they walked/ran/rode in the stroller for the 5 km, they were not given a placement in the results. Also, Flo Blackwood wants everyone to know that she won a raffle prize of a sweater and chocolates after the race. 

## Go Fish

We released bags of baby fish into Lake Felicity recently, along with some bacteria to help clear the muck on the base of the water. We’re hoping they don’t all get eaten by the turtles before they have a chance to reproduce and grow in size and number. In a few weeks, it’ll be the perfect place to cast a line for all of you fishermen out there! Meanwhile the builders have also made a little  progress on the house, which will hopefully be done in a year.

## End-of-year State Testing

All of the student’s of BBSG had to take their state testing this week. It was tough, but we survived. On the other hand, hallelujah! We have come to our final week of school! Everyone is very much looking forward to a nice loooong break,  especially since we had to take very little breaks over the school year to get done this early. Bon été ! (that’s french for, “Happy summer!”)
