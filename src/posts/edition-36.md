## Goodbye to Snowflake

BBSG faced a tragic loss this week, when we ate our final free gourmet-cooked meal at Snowflake. We received our final visitor badges, said farewell to all Zachary’s co-workers, and then drove off to nowhere in particular. We will greatly miss our fancy breakfasts with lots of whipped cream, thick smoothies, glazed doughnuts, and also our lunches of hamburgers, pizza, chicken, salads, sodas, and plenty of desserts. But now, we are back to pre-cooked, frozen, ultra-processed foods which the RV life provides. Goodbye, farewell, adieu, au revoir, sayonara Snowflake!

## Girls' Movie Marathon

On our last night in San Francisco, Zachary Blackwood went to a dinner party with his work friends, meanwhile, the rest of BBSG had a movie night. We watched the entire five-hour ‘Pride and Prejudice’ film, though it took two days which meant Zachary was agonizingly forced to watch the end with us. Allison Blackwood, served as the photographer slash videographer, making sure to snap many pictures of the kissing scenes.

## More National Parks

We have got two more national parks checked off in just one week. Grand–something, and Desert, uh, something.  The main point though, is that we went there. With them finished, we are now on our way back towards Indiana! Speaking of which, just twelve more days until we get there!! “Long Joe” is getting shorter by the day, and everyone is very excited.!\[]
