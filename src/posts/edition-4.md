## Big Tooth-Losing Streak!

This week, just after dinner Allison Blackwood had her father pull out her third tooth! Later that night, Elsie Blackwood ripped out two of hers. But if you think that’s revolting, just wait ‘till you hear that Allie had Zachary Blackwood pull out her other front tooth two days later! This seems to be turning into idiosyncratic pastime at Blackwood Boarding, and Flo B. is hoping it will dwindle quickly. Obviously, the tooth fairy has been very busy this week at BBSG.


## The Boilers and “El Muro”

Elsie Blackwood’s hands were up like a wall during this Saturday's Boiler ball game. With her new title El Muro (Spanish for “The Wall”) Elsie wouldn’t let a ball past her incredible skyscraping limbs. Z. Blackwood says, “Zach Edey couldn’t have gotten it over those arms!” If she keeps up her amazing blocking, the Boilermakers will have an excellent chance next game.   



## Freezing rain, snow and hail hits West Lafayette
This week it’s been unpredictable on and off freezing temperatures. It’s gone from melty to freezy to melty again and again! We’ve had hail that turned to slush that turned to rain, and then froze when it hit. Look out for more wild wintry forecasts in the Lafayette area for the next few weeks. It’s undoubtedly pretty tough trying to be a weatherman in Indiana.
