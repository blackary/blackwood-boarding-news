## Gamenights with Cousins 

Early this week, BBSG spent a night in Indianapolis with our Sturm cousins for one of their birthdays. We played board games and of course had some cake and ice cream. Then the very next night we headed over to Aunt Cari and Uncle Sergei’s for more snacks and games and stayed up late. The new family favorite is Camel Up, a game where you bet on camel racing. Flo Blackwood says, “It’s a good thing we went to Los Angelis before we got the game because my gambling streak is on FIRE. 

## Happy 2026! 

This year was a fairly low-key New Year’s Eve, in which Blackwood Boarding School spent the evening with Grandma and Grandpa Faris and the Sturms at the farm having root beer floats and of course, playing board games–including Camel Up to be sure. Unfortunately, no one felt like staying up until midnight so we just went to bed as soon as we got home instead. Happy New Year to all, and to all a good night! 



## The Faris Family Christmas Gathering

Zachary and Flo B. were very excited to try out the BINGO version of white elephant at this year's Faris Christmas party, and it was a hit! Players had to score a BINGO instead of being the next number, and they could then open a new gift or steal one as usual. There were some useful home items, candy, and many, many Chick-fil-a gift cards which were fought hard for. The rest of the party was mostly playing games and snacking while everyone chit-chattered away. It was a lovely family time for the end of the busy holidays.
