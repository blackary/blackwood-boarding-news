## A Spectacular CHDT Performance

This past week was the play by the second stage of Christus Homines Drama Troupe on Friday and Saturday. All the kids had a fun time at tech week all day every day for a whole week! Both performances and the dress rehearsal were huge successes! Felicity B. from BBSG starred as Karlee Keene, and in a few days the junior cast will be putting on their show, with another Blackwood Boarding student performing! Fortunately, the Jr. Cast tech week is not quite as demanding as Second Stage. Look forward to another fun play this Thursday at Duncan Hall, which Elsie Blackwood claims will be much better than the first show, but Felicity Blackwood highly doubts that. 
## More Packing…

Flo Blackwood the main teacher at Blackwood Boarding has been packing packing packing and more packing. Almost everything is now inside “Classy” sitting in  the driveway. It has recently been very difficult for anyone to find anything for everyday use, such as lotion, cups, clothing, and even food! Things are getting drastic, and students are concerned that before long, the RV will be so stuffed, it might explode at any moment! But there is still more stuff to come, because we leave this Friday with two extra guinea pigs for our “maiden voyage”. Also, a shout out to the In-a-way family for hosting us twice which has been very helpful! (:

## Angry Birds

This is no video game! We’ve had several birds constantly attacking the RV for the past few days! After being chased away time and time again, the feathery furies just keep coming. The cause may be that they see their own reflections in the windows, or that the vehicle is parked too close to their nest. Either way, these birds are clearly demonstrating the aspects of their relatives the dinos! Meanwhile, perhaps planning with these RV-hating birds, a little chickadee made its way into the house, and wouldn’t get out until we were finally able to shoo it down the hallway and out the garage. What’s next? Geese splattering our partially built house in white guano?! Yup, that happened too.
