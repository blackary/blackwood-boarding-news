In a remarkable display of eloquence and critical thinking, Blackwood Boarding School's debate team has won the New England Preparatory School Debate Championship for the third consecutive year.

The team, led by senior captains Michael Park and Emma Rodriguez, demonstrated exceptional skill throughout the two-day competition, particularly excelling in the final round against Phillips Academy on the topic of renewable energy policy.

"This victory represents months of preparation and dedication," says Coach Dr. Rebecca Thompson. "Our students showed remarkable poise under pressure and demonstrated the intellectual rigor that Blackwood is known for."

The victory automatically qualifies the team for the National Preparatory School Debate Finals in Washington, D.C. this spring. The school community will hold a celebration dinner next week to honor the team's achievement.
