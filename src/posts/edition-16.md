## Hammock Rammack
The cherry trees in front of Blackwood Boarding School are now supporting not one, not two, but five hammocks! Before the swinging seats arrived, Flo Blackwood mentioned, “Well, whoever puts up their hammock will have to share it with everyone because we can only fit one at a time.” Her thoughts were proven wrong when that very day, five of the swings were secured in the branches, and Elsie B. is entertaining the idea of fastening all seven relaxation centers in the trees. 

## Multi-Birthday Celebrations
This week included the birthdays of Emory and Flo Blackwood, who turned 9 and 36 years old! Emory had a big birthday party, with four friends and received many presents. (hopefully we’ll be able to fit them all in the RV) She got a cup of slime, a watch, two notebooks, markers, pens, a walking talking penguin toy, a bracelet making kit, gummy bears, two books, stationary, a fluffy pillow, a water bottle holder, pin art board, thirty dollars, stickers, a bracelet, and a water bottle. Flo received some candy and a fit-bit. 



## Upcoming Tech Weeks for CHDT

The homeschool drama troupe has been hard at work for weeks to produce the two younger kids’ performances of “Bringing Down the House” and “Fantastic Mr. Fox” brought to you by the second stage and junior cast groups. This will be tech week for  second stage, and then for the junior cast in the following week. Felicity Blackwood will be acting as Karlee Keene in “Bringing Down the House” along with a few others from church, and Elsie Blackwood will be performing in “Fantastic Mr. Fox” as Vivienne Lily Cor. The first play will be this Friday and Saturday evenings, and the junior cast show will be the next thursday. Everyone is doing great at practices, and it’s looking like both theatrical presentations will be very entertaining and uproarious!
