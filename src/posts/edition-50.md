## Back to School Already?!

This week, unfortunately, marked the end of Christmas break and the start of a new semester of math, history, language arts, and tears. This time we got off to a fairly good start, especially considering that everyone can see and hear everyone else at the same time, since there aren’t any doors in the basement. At least now BBSG can have the satisfaction of being more than halfway done with the entire year, and can start looking forward to Summer vacation!

## The Stuffed Animals Return

Now that there is a little extra space for a while, Emory and Allison Blackwood convinced school teacher Flo B. to retrieve the school’s bean bag filled to the brim with stuffed toys. The gigantic ball was hoisted to the top of the stairs, and then was accidentally rolled down the stairs, knocking a few students over in its path. However, as soon as it was down, the bag was zipped open and piles of fluffy animal toys spilled out! The mounds of critters were quickly sorted, leaving Blackwood Boarding Girls with an abundance of animals, Zachary Blackwood with a total of two, and Flo Blackwood with one. Now that the long lost collection of friends has finally returned, Lottie Blackwood proclaims, “Bonjour, stuffies!”

## Tooth Operation

“I don’t want to say anything about it.” says Allison Blackwood after her operation yanking out two of her baby teeth at the dentist. We’re not sure if this means it was boring, or absolutely terrifying…or maybe she just didn’t want to be interviewed for a prestigious school newspaper, but you can probably guess. She received a fox toy to contain her two teeth and got to keep her grape-flavored gas mask. She now has two less teeth, two extra dollars, and a more spacious mouth.
