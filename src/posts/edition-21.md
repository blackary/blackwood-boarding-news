## Fourth Annual RGFCamp

The past weekend was our yearly Family Camp for RGC. It was a very fun time and everyone enjoyed it. Even if it did get a little rainy at times. Fortunately, the rain was mostly in the morning when we had classes, other than that we had sunny warm weather perfect for frisbee, boating, swimming, and other outdoor activities! The girls’ cabin room got an extra extra good review from the room inspectors, which may or may not have been due to the doughnuts and the large“We Love Inspectors” sign made of tape on the wall, also featuring paper flowers, and photos of cats and dogs! 
## Cereal Killer on the Loose! 

A tragic loss at Blackwood Boarding has left a hole in our hearts, and a fish in the Held’s toilet. During our fun time at camp, the recently adopted Orange Washington was being cared for, little did we know that back in Lafayette, a killer was at work. Police have been searching and have discovered the culprit! The cereal killer is none other than… Nadia Spirydovich! (soon to be Nadia Smith.) She was put in charge of him during church camp, and though it be outrageous, she has received no jail sentence, and is free to go where she pleases, so watch out! You could be the next culprit. A funeral was held in  Orange’s honor on Saturday. Washington aged about four years and three weeks. Now we say a last goodbye to our dear goldfish. Goodbye Orange Washington, you will be greatly missed. 

## Life on Angelic Lane
We’ve been camping out on our land lately, watching the workers work, playing on Lake Felicity, and getting muddy in the construction area. Basically, life here consists of going to the pond, back to the RV, and repeat. Teddy has especially been enjoying jumping out of the canoe and going for a swim with the turtles. At night, you can look at the woods, glittering with fireflies, and the deer running about, and you can even hear a loud noise..a chainsaw maybe? No, that’s just Dad snoring in the back.
