## BBSG in Washington D.C.

Most of the end of our third loop in the repulsively vitriolic (RV) was in Washington D.C. where we did a lot of stuff! Of course, Flo Blackwood had us go to all the historic sites and landmarks, like the Lincoln memorial, the Washington monument, and the capitol building of the US. Meanwhile the principal, Zachary B., took everyone to the international spy museum. While students enjoyed most of this, the highlight was an adorable little squirrel eating a sandwich in the park! 

## Homecoming!

Blackwood Boarding girls were very excited to finally come home after a looooooooong trip in the northeast. Students are also glad to no longer have any lice whatsoever. Not one single one. (In case anyone was worried) And we will be seeing as many people as we can while we’re here. If you’re not doing anything, feel free to drop by lot #4 Angelic Lane! 

## Lots of Headway on the House
Since we were gone, the builders of the new, and much more spacious, Blackwood Boarding School for Girls have made great progress on the structure! The building now resembles an actual house. There are walls on the outside, a fully done roof, some wiring and plumbing, and windows! When asked what she thought about the construction in an interview, Elsie Blackwood remarked, “I think it’s coming along well.” Flo B. also said to the builders, “It’s looking GREAT!” Everyone else thinks so too, but we hope it gets done soon, really really soon, so we can move out of Classy!!!!
