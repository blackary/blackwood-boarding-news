## Moving Out

Blackwood Boarding School is really emptying out, especially since our big furniture moving party! We rented a U-Haul truck and stuffed everyone who came with ice cream, brownies, and root-beer. Students (and teachers) are now sleeping on the floor and using fold up card tables for meals. The piano was also taken out and replaced with a fancy keyboard with four hundred music styles.Â 



## An Exhilarating RGC Youth Group Retreat!

Well the pancake breakfast fundraiser in January finally paid off, and our entire youth group and a few others were able to take a weekend vacation to Arrowhead Pass! The lodge was amazing, and outside included swings, a pond where you could fish, canoe, and swim, and plenty of room to run around and play games. There were study sessions in the morning, afternoon and sometimes evening on a variety of topics, but the main speaker talked about the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness. All the kids enjoyed playing knockout, werewolf, eating tons of junk food, staying up way too late, and getting up way too early. There is lots more that could be said, but it was a joyful few days that will not quickly be forgotten.

## Creepy-Crawly Bug Bowl!
The annual Purdue Bug Bowl happened this week and many of the students from BBSG were able to go. The festivities included arts and crafts, animals, projects, games, prizes, and lots of freebies. Unfortunately, the cotton candy was not free this year, and cost three dollars, so there were a few disappointments. But overall, BBSG and a couple of friends had a good time.
