## Candy Cane Experience

This week we had the pleasurable experience of going to the candy shop downtown with some other friends, and touring their candy-cane-making room upstairs. We were all served chocolate truffles while we waited in the seating area, and then headed up the spiral staircase to the amazing pepperminty smelling chamber above the old-fashioned candy store. After watching them transform the hot sticky syrup into rods of red and white candy, everyone got their own stick, and got to shape it however they liked. Lottie Blackwood, put a clever spin on her peppermint stick, turning it into a pair of glasses. 

## On the Road Again…

The day after our candy cane factory tour, was a tragic one at BBSG. It was the day our retreat back home ended, and we drove off again to some random state in the middle of nowhere in particular. But, there is a glimmer of hope on this expedition, since it is our second-to-last of the entire RV trip!  However this one is very very long, so students Lottie and Felicity Blackwood have fabricated “Long Joe 2” our second paper chain countdown to count the days until we can be back in our native state.

## Buffet Breakfast

One of the first places Blackwood Boarding has stopped on this loop of our trip was a restaurant parking lot that just happened to have a buffet for breakfast! Zachary Blackwood decided that this would make a lovely meal before zooming off again. Everyone enjoyed pilling their plates with biscuits, gravy, eggs, doughnuts, bacon, fruit, and french toast. We would recommend the place to anyone in the area (or parking lot).
