## Crocs and Gators

“Ooo, look! Take a picture of me next to this alli–” CHOMP! Oops, looks like we lost another student! Oh well. This week we went to the Everglades National Park where there were many alligators as well as a few crocodiles. The gators mostly just sat there with their eyes open, but whenever one looked our way, Flo Blackwood would declare, “Girls it’s looking at you. Step back! I mean it! It could jump out and attack you!!” Besides being nearly eaten alive, it was still interesting to see the enormous reptiles.

## Yummy Pie in the Keys

There’s only one reason the Blackwood Boarding Girls’ ever knew the Florida Keys existed before we went there, and that’s key lime pie. So of course we had to try some in the place where the delicious dessert was invented! It came in big slices with about six inches of meringue on top. Although it was good, one student remarked that she thought the frozen stuff was still better. 

## Evacuation!

This week when the whole family was coming home from shopping, everyone smelled a disgusting gasoline odor. But Zachary Blackwood insisted that it would go away, so everyone went to bed. After an hour or so however, the stench was stronger than ever, so the principal finally agreed it was likely a gas leak. The school climbed into the car and drove off to a motel in town. It was very nice, with two large beds in each room (which we rented two of) a television, shower/bath, minifridge, and a microwave! Lottie B. in particular enjoyed laying back on the bed and scrolling through the TV channels, laughing hysterically at everything from funny commercials to hockey games! The next day the gas leak checkers said that it was nothing, got rid of the smell and we could come back like nothing had happened.
