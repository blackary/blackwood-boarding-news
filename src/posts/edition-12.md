## BBSG Student Body President Results!
On Wednesday, as promised, the Blackwood Boarding School for Girls’ presidential vote was held. It was very close and nearly ended in a perfect tie! But in the end, Emory G. and Allison were voted in as president and vice president! Emory’s first order was to create our official school colors, black, green, and gold. After the election Lottie B. was made the official school cheer-leader, and later even received her own personal pom-poms. She was very willing to accept the office. Everyone was satisfied with the way things turned out, and hope this will be an outstanding term!

## I Slap Floor Success

April Fools finally came, and everyone was all-in on pranking each other at Blackwood Boarding! There was soap on toothbrushes, marbles and plastic dinos in beds, and yummy “cake pops” that were really frozen meatballs covered in chocolate and sprinkles. Watch out for next year!

## Bye Bye Grand Trophy

March Madness is over already! But, after Purdue lost no one really cared about it anyway. There was a final four watch party at BBSG where everyone ate candy and pop, and guessed what product all the commercials were advertising. At the end of the game…someone won. But the sad part was that now we have to say goodbye to Elsie’s March Madness trophy she won last year. Allison and Lottie said, “Goodbye dear trophy!” as they kissed the golden cup farewell.
