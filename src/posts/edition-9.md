## Boilers Lose their Final Game

Team Boilermakers had yet another terrible loss, but, at least it will be their last. Most of the players were very much ready for the season to be over. But everyone will always remember that one time we won one game. Since the entire Lutz family was absent for the game, Zachary Blackwood served as the assistant to the assistant to the backup coach. Unfortunately, Audrey Lutz was one of our main shooters, and the Boilers only managed to make 3 baskets. The other team, however, made at least 25… It was probably our worst game ever. This was kind of a sour note to end the season on, but, we were the best team in heart--and nothing else.

## The Sun is Shining!

This week spring has come! Allison and Lottie Blackwood even enjoyed an all-day pool party in the backyard. They even began to force others to join them by spraying with the hose, and dumping buckets of soapy water. At the end of the day, when Flo Blackwood was taking in their towels, she accidentally forgot to shake them out, and they filled the washing-machine with leaves. That is why, if you go into the BBSG laundry room, you will see lots of little brown confetti. 

## Cool Project at Blackwood Boarding

A few days ago, the students at BBSG built a fun laser tag game with goggles. If you get hit, the goggles block your vision for a few seconds, while the other person prepares to shoot. There were a few mistakes while in progress of putting them together, but they worked great in the end. Come to Blackwood Boarding School for Girls to experience a fantastic lazer-filled spy game.
