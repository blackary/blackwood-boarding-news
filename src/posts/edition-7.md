## The Boilermakers Won!!!!!!
We finally had a very close game this Saturday and actually won our first game! Coach Nolan exclaimed that it was only because of ‘El Muro’s’ excellent blocking that the other team was kept from scoring time and time again. In the end, the Boilers won by one basket. The fans cheered and jumped up from their seats. Everyone was over the moon, they had finally been victorious! Afterward, some of the fans and players went out to ice cream at Culver’s to celebrate! It was one exhilarating game. 



## Blackwood House Staked out

This Friday we settled on the final location of the house on our land at last. Most of the floor plans are finished as well, other than some of the electrical and plumbing. The builders were a little set back from when they were hoping to start digging, but they should begin the process in April! 



## Weekend Happenings

For two days this week, several people from West Lafayette went to a very fancy women’s retreat held in Zionsville. There was a great abundance of candy, as well as live classical music upon entry. The biggest highlights of course, was the speaker, Courtney Doctor, who talked about oneness with and in Christ. Meanwhile, back home, Zachary Blackwood and the rest of BBSG tested out “Classy,” our newly purchased mobile-home. Elsie Blackwood commented, “The wrapping paper on the beds was very slippery and noisy.” Zachary remarked, “Sleeping in there definitely will take some adjustment. And we need lots of curtains.” Obviously, it was an early morning, and a bustling Saturday.
