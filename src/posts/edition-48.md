## BBSG Gliding On Ice 

This week Blackwood Boarding Girls were finally able to go ice skating for the first time this year, and it was Lottie Blackwood’s first time using real skates! Unfortunately she is not feeling inclined to share anything about her experience, but we are pretty sure she struggled a little at first, but enjoyed herself after getting used to it. 

## Another Routine Christmas Morning

This Wednesday, as most of you probably know, was Christmas. The Blackwood Boarding Girls woke up, read the Christmas story in Matthew, opened presents, smiled for pictures, tried out presents, and then drove off to The Farm to spend the afternoon with Grandma and Grandpa Faris. We played board games, ate sugary snacks, and chit-chatted. Flo B. remarked, “Well, it was nice to be cozy, but not too cozy for a change.” Some favorite presents were tickets to a Purdue game, given to Zachary and Flo Blackwood by each other, some corgi notebooks for Allison Blackwood, a german shepherd blanket for Emory Blackwood, and nothing for Teddy! (the dog we already have.) Overall, it was a nice quiet Christmas that everyone enjoyed.

## After-Christmas Thrifting

After picking up our lovely friends and former fellow RVers Jane and Audrey, BBSG took an afternoon trip to Sell It Here, Flo Blackwood’s favorite store in town. After walking through aisle after aisle of antiques, it was very surprising that we actually did not break anything! We looked for the most absurd items, tried on ugly hats (which hopefully didn’t contain any lice…) and sang Christmas songs. Afterwards, what better way to end a shopping trip than with ice cream? We got to use our free Frosty keychains one last time before they expire at the end of the year.
