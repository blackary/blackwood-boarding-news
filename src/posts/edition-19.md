## Bothun’s Hair Salon Open for Business
Wednesday was filled with thrilling chop opportunities available to everyone on the maiden voyage crew at BBSG. Armed with a single pair of scissors and lots of hair spray, Felicity and Jane opened a hair salon called, “Bothun’s”. Their first two customers Elsie and Lottie Blackwood were very pleased with their outstanding cuts, and received many compliments over the week. Contact Flo Blackwood today if you’re interested in a stylish yet adorable new look, and you could be our next client at Bothun’s! 

## Excellent Camping Spot at RTA

We stayed at a very relaxing and fun place in Minnesota called “Rockie Top Acres” with alpacas, dogs, goats, a few cows, cats, and chickens. There was plenty of space to run around, and even a campfire where we enjoyed many many s'mores and marshmallow throwing contests. Amazingly, during our stay, a baby alpaca was born! The adorable little thing we were later told was named Flo, after the one who first witnessed the cria after birth. All the students and guests at Blackwood Boarding agreed that it was a great place that we would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area.

## Partying at Miriam’s!

While we stayed near Rochester MN at the alpaca farm, we spent much time with our lovely cousin Miriam who showed us around town, gave us a tour of Mayo Hospital where she works, and spoiled us like crazy. One night we managed to draw a hop-scotch reaching all the way across her apartment driveway and reaching a whopping one hundred and seventy eight blocks! The Sturm family also made it to the gathering for a couple days, as they were at the beginning of their big out west trip. Miriam took us to one of her favorite breakfast restaurants where they served a Hollish dish called pannenkoeken which was quite delicious. Also if you ever need to have a major surgery or something, see if you can get into Mayo and have Miriam nurse you back to health (she’ll give you stickers, heated blankets, shows, games, and all kinds of snacks and candy too!)
