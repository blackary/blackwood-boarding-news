## Sun Heating things Up

Summer weather has truly arrived with smoldering students at BBSG. On a visit to “The Ark” students enjoyed being indoors with the air conditioning, but, once we stepped outside, the intense roasting of the fireball in the sky burned up most enjoyment for the rest of the day. (Fortunately it was evening, so we didn’t have to put up with, well, we won’t mention any names but…a supposedly “hypothermic” someone, for much longer.)

## High-5 for Lottie! 

It was a very exciting and long anticipated day for Lottie Blackwood. She just turned five years old! Well, she hasn’t actually turned five yet, but she did have a great party while we were back in Indiana for a few days. There were balloons, cake, glowsticks, and lots of friends! In fact, she had such a good time, she decided to have another party, on her real birthday while we visit our Mann cousins and Uncle Don and Aunt Gwen in upstate New York. Look forward to another fun day. 
## Headway on New BBSG Location

Walls and roofs are going up fast on the property on Angelic Land, and now what was just a dirt hole a few months ago, is actually beginning to resemble a house! We had our former adopted sisters, Jane and Audrey Lutz over for an afternoon to run around the house and swim, fish, and canoe in the pond! We also enjoyed a game of town in the new school building. Students are really hoping the project gets done soon, before we all go crazy cramped in the RV!
