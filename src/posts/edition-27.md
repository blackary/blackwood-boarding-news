## Sticks and Stones…and Scooters

An unfortunate accident occurred this week at the current location of BBSG. Flo Blackwood told Elsie, Emory, and Allison they could scooter down the little slope in our campground one time and then come back to finish school. So they all slowly pushed off down the small hill, but Allie stopped herself too quickly, rolled off her scooter, and onto the road. She ended up with bloody scrapes all over her right side, and an arm broken in two places. She now has a splint and sling, and the doctors are hoping to get her into a cast by Wednesday. After most of the trauma was over, she said, “Other than the pain and the disabilities, it’s OK.” Of course, probably part of the reason she said that is because she has had way more privileges than when Felicity Blackwood broke her arm…Just saying. If you would like to show your sympathy, and give Allie something fun to look at, we will be back in Lafayette on Thursday August 7th for anyone to come over and sign her cast.

## Week-long Partying with Cousins

We have cousins in Boston, who knew?! Who we have been spending much time with over the past week. We went to the beach (before Allison broke her arm) got ice cream, and had a s’mores night at our campground. But just as we were finishing up some hastily cooked marshmallow sandwiches, it began to pour rain. Everyone clambered into the camper, and stayed squished inside through the storm. By the time the rain let up, we were in the middle of a shallow pond of rainwater! Our relatives, (the Nwosus) had to climb over a picnic table to get out. We are looking forward to hanging out with them more since we’re stuck in Boston for a few extra days.

## Plymouth Rock

Blackwood Boarding took a trip to Plymouth Rock recently and students enjoyed most things, but not the actual rock. Seriously, it was just a rock. You’re average everyday ordinary gray rock. They have it in this big colosseum thing because some guy decided that it was the first rock the pilgrims stepped on. But, he said that hundreds of years later, so students were a little sceptical. The rest of the historic tour was something like a minnie Conner Prairie, which BBSGers have always liked, and we especially enjoyed the butter popcorn (of course, not quite as good as in Indiana)
