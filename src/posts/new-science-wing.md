Today marked a historic moment for Blackwood Boarding School as we officially opened the doors to our new state-of-the-art science wing. The 25,000-square-foot facility represents the school's largest infrastructure investment in the past decade.

The new wing includes:

- Three advanced chemistry laboratories
- Two physics research spaces
- A dedicated environmental science greenhouse
- A robotics and engineering workshop
- Student research pods for independent projects
- A 120-seat lecture hall with advanced visualization technology

"This facility will transform how our students engage with science," says Dr. James Morrison, Head of Science Department. "From hands-on research opportunities to advanced equipment access, we're providing our students with university-level resources at the secondary school level."

The wing's first classes will begin next week, with special workshops and demonstrations planned throughout the semester to showcase the new capabilities to current and prospective students.
