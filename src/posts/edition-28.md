## Citied Out

As we at BBSG make our way across New England, we have of course gone through many major cities, such as New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and we’re making our way to Washington DC. We’ve toured many famous historic sites like the Liberty Bell (that’s a 25 minute wait for a five minute look and quick pic with the surprisingly small bell) Elles Island, the Statue of Liberty (which is unpredictably not packed with tourists, but it does have very long lines for overpriced ice cream), and the ‘most historic’ square mile in America, along with the everyday city life of sky scrapers, business suits, and millionaires’ go to shops. After weeks of walking and stopping to take photos with landmarks, Flo Blackwood says, “Yeah..I’m kind of all citied out.”

## Lego Land Wonders

“It’s really fun!” said Allison B. after our trips to the Lego Lands in NYC and Philadelphia. Some of the highlights were creating our own lego people, playing a magic wand shooting game in little carts, and the 4D movie theatre! All of those things were in the indoor LEGO playground in Philly, and in New York, we just went to the store and made minifigures, that’s what they call LEGO people apparently. We also learned that LEGO is the company that makes the most tires in the world, but some students are skeptical if little toy tires really count…

## Lottie’s Chicken Expertise

Our latest campsite for our Repulsively Vitriolic hunk-o-junk, is a quiet little farm, well, quiet when the geese aren’t around. Never get geese. Other animals are two very fat pigs, a few cows, and lots of chickens who Lottie has taken a liking to. She has a whole system of feeding them little bud things off a bush, telling them all to “Come to Mama!” and “March!” if they want some food. Ask her if you need any tips for your chicken farm, she’ll be happy to tell you anything you’ll need to know.
