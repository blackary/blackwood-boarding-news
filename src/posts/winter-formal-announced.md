The Blackwood Boarding School Student Council is thrilled to announce that this year's Winter Formal will transform the Grand Hall into a magical celestial wonderland under the theme "A Night Under the Stars."

The event, scheduled for February 15th, will feature:

- Stunning constellation-inspired decorations
- A professional photographer for memorable moments
- Live music from the acclaimed Jazz Ensemble
- Special starlight refreshments

"We wanted to create something truly magical this year," says Sarah Chen, Student Council President. "The theme allows us to turn our historic Grand Hall into an enchanting space that celebrates both our school's tradition and the wonder of a starlit winter night."

Tickets will go on sale next week in the Student Commons. Early bird pricing will be available for the first 100 students.
