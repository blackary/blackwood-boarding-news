## More Birthday Glitz and Glam

For Elsie Blackwood’s twelfth birthday she not only got her ears pierced, but also had a girls’ afternoon at the nail salon with her Lutz girl friends and wonderful older sister. The employees at DJ Nails were excellent hosts, giving Elsie a delectable cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes next door, and leading all the customers in a round of off-tune happy birthday! After receiving our manicures and taking a few modeling photos, the group set off for an exciting excursion to Payless for a scavenger hunt, while waiting for Zachary Blackwood to drive over to pick everyone up. “It was a little awkward since the guy kept talking in an accent that I couldn’t really understand him..But it was still fun and I think we should do it more often.” -Elsie B. during interview

## A Tradition Continued

This week we got to meet yet again with our Mann cousins in upstate New York. This time we stayed at a KOA campground which had a pool, jump pads, mini golf, and free candy. We of course, continued our years-old tradition of getting sick (lice included) every time we meet up with them, and by the second night, all were coughing, getting out of bed to get more tissues and or blankets, and ravenously devouring cough drops for agonizingly sore throats. Even though we weren’t all feeling our best, we did get ice cream so it was OK. Anyways, we of course had a great time (other than the fevers and discomforted throats) hanging out with our long-lost NY cousins.

## Sweater Weather–Tripod Style

As cooler temperatures approach, Teddy, BBSG’s three-legged puppy mascot, has been getting a little chilly. It just so happened that a thrift store in the town we were staying in was having a sale on dog sweaters, (only two dollars a piece!) so Flo Blackwood insisted we purchase one for Teddy, who had just gotten a hair cut and was shivering all the time. Teddy is feeling warmer and loving his new outfit.
