## Splish Splash

At one of our campgrounds in Tennessee, we took full advantage of the two pools, which we visited every chance we got. In fact we spent at least three hours swimming every day we were there. You might think, “Why would they do that? Wouldn’t they have loads of exciting things to do?” Well, if you lived in an RV, you’d understand. With so much pool time, we even created our own synchronized swimming routine, and Lottie Blackwood learned to swim! She says, “I love swimming! And I’m gonna take the swim test the next time we go to the gym.” 

## Wedding Bells in Nashville

“It was lovely.” says G. Flo B. after attending the ceremony of William T. Hanson and his bride Sweet Caroline…🎶bum bum buuuum🎶… The Faris family was very excited, as this has been the first grandchild marriage, way to go Will! At the reception there was dancing,  live music, and lots of cousins. Unfortunately, some guests were disappointed that there was no ice cream served after dinner, but BBSG made up for that on the way home. 

## 37-Year-Old Goes Spelunking

For the thirty-seventh birthday of Zachary Blackwood (Blackwood Boarding Principal), BBSG went out to breakfast, took a cave exploring tour through Diamond Cave, and got ice cream! The ice cream was probably the best part. Mmm! The cave was also interesting and educational. Sadly, Diamond Cave does not actually have a single diamond in it, but it is still a cool place. There is even an altar where people used to have weddings down there. It probably would’ve been a little too cramped for W&C though! It is safe to say that Principal Dad had a great birthday party, and no one forgot in the slightest about his big day…because..that would be ridiculous, hehe.
