## Zachary and Flo Blackwood’s 15th

This week school principal Zachary Blackwood and Kindergarten - 4th grade teacher Flo Blackwood celebrated their crystal anniversary. BBSG students all contributed to give them a self address stamp for “Blackwood Manor”, our newly named plot of land. In the evening, we went into town and looked at couches where we could design our own couches. Zachary said, “Using little blocks to build my own couch was very fun.” and then went out to eat. “I just felt very thankful that it's been 15 wonderful years.” -Flo B.

## Diamond Hunting!

On Friday, all of Blackwood Boarding took an excursion to hunt for diamonds in Arkansas! We marched into the fields, shovels in hand, eager to strike rich. After many hours shoveling the soggy earth and sifting through the rocks to find shimmery million dollar gems, we trudged home hot and muddy, and unfortunately without any sparkling treasures. One BBSG student comments, “It was pretty uneventful but it was interesting because there were a lot of funny looking rocks, but no one really found a diamond except one guy who was like, a professional who went gold hunting and looked for fish skeletons in some far far away place.” Well, there you have it.

## Another Alpaca Farm

We have travelled to our second alpaca farm on our trip. (The first one, if you don’t know, was on our very first loop in Minnesota.) There are lots of alpacas and dogs and ducks and chickens and turkeys. Some students say it may be even better than the first, but others disagree. For one thing, this one doesn’t have friends, and no baby alpacas have been born, on the other hand we are free to roam around with and pet all the animals. It’s a tough competition, but who will win?!
