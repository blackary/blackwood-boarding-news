## BBSG at The Splendid Couloir

Earlier this week the Blackwood Boarding group visited yet another so-called “preeminent” national park, the Grand Canyon. Elsie Blackwood says, “It seems like all the national parks are supposed to be the best. But, as far as they go, this one was nice.” Yes nice, and also cold and snowy! Everyone enjoyed throwing snowballs into the canyon, and a few times over again so Mom could record it.

## MORE Alpacas?!

On our way though the dry red desert of the southwest, Blackwood Boarding enjoyed visiting our fourth harvest host (a group of RV hosting farms across the country) with alpacas. However, the llama-like animals were not the only fun thing to see at this place. There was a corn pit, baby bunnies, goats with no ears, a giant plastic slide, and a very exciting bike powered roller coaster! Everyone at BBSG would highly rate this superb venue, which is hopefully soon to be opening other locations around the country if you would like to visit one. 

## We Love Sugar

In Las Vegas recently, we stopped by a place Zachary Blackwood had visited when he came to the city a few years ago, a huge candy shop called I Love Sugar. The first floor had gummies, sour candies, sugar candy, lollipops, and other fruity sweets, while the second floor included chocolatey, minty, and caramelly confectionaries. Upon entry, Allison Blackwood commented, “WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!”
