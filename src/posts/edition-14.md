## Ground-Breaking News!

The New Blackwood Boarding School for Girls building is finally really and truly underway! Building is started and there will soon be a house-looking structure in the field. Flo Blackwood is most excited, and can’t wait to see the final results, which should be open to the public next spring.


## BBSG Camping Trip
Blackwood Boarding took a field trip to Turkey Run this weekend, enjoyed hiking trails and picking wildflowers. They were joined by a few other local schools as well, (who’s teachers happen to be sisters with our teacher) Everyone got very hot and dirty, but greatly enjoyed and took advantage of the cool-water pump next to the campsite.



## Run for Justice Coming up

The Run for Justice (launched by International Justice Mission, a company helping put an end to human trafficking around the world) is this weekend, and team Redeeming Grace is excited and ready to go! Runners from ages 11 and up will be competing, and there is also a kids dash for ages 10 and under the day before. It looks like it will be a calorie-burning and sweat-provoking race.
