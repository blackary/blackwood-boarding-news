## At the Zoo with Granda and Nana

One of the first activities we enjoyed when we got to Colorado Springs was to go to the city zoo with Zachary’s parents (whose front lawn was the current BBSG location.) We fed the giraffes, watched the orangutans chomp on their lettuce, saw penguins, tigers, Patagonian maras, and much more. Blackwood Boarding Girls would highly recommend the giraffe feeding to anyone in the area.!\[]

## B﻿BSG on "America's Mountain"

During our visit to Colorado we also took an afternoon to drive up Pikes Peak to enjoy the view, and eat some doughnuts which are traditionally served at the visitor’s center. The drive up was full of yellow and salmon coloured aspen trees and plenty of ‘animal x-ing’ signs, but no animals. On the ride down however, we encountered a small group of mountain sheep, with a cute little baby too. 

## Welcome to Adventures in Odyssey!

As many of you know, Colorado Springs Colorado 80995 is home to Focus on the Family, which produces the kids radio drama program “Adventures in Odyssey”. Of course BBSG students had to stop by while we were in town. Students enjoyed recording our very own episode in the recording studio, with Emory, Allison, and Lottie as the foley team, and Felicity and Elsie as actresses. And I’m the news staff, hoping you’ll join us again next time for more Blackwood Boarding News!
